  title: "What is Blast Fishing?",
  text: `Blast fishing, also termed dynamite fishing, involves fishers using explosives as
         a quick and easy way to kill fish. Explosives can be home-made or sourced illegally,
         and when detonated the underwater shock wave kills indiscriminately all marine
         creatures within a certain radius as wellas shattering the underlying coral 
         reef. Ultimately, widespread blast fishing reduces the overall productivity and
         diversity of that ocean area with long-term negative impacts on both the ecosystem,
         and fisheries.`

  text: ` Blast fishing is an illegal activity and its sound can be heard 30km away. Sea Sensors has placed four underwater acoustic recorders and hydrophones on the sea bed along the coast of Tanzania. Collectively, they are monitoring approximately 20% of the entire coast of the country, and will record all sounds in the marine environment over the course of 2 years.  The data is then analysed to identify blasts and where possible triangulate the original location of the blast. `
