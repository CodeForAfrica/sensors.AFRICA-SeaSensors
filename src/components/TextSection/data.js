  title: "What is Blast Fishing?",
  text: `Blast fishing, also termed dynamite fishing, involves fishers using explosives as
         a quick and easy way to kill fish. Explosives can be home-made or sourced illegally,
         and when detonated the underwater shock wave kills indiscriminately all marine
         creatures within a certain radius as wellas shattering the underlying coral 
         reef. Not only does it kill many creatures that are never usedby fishers, it also
         kills the young and juveniles, and damaged coral can take decades to recover.Ultimately,
         widespread blast fishing reduces the overall productivity and diversity
         of the area with long-term impacts on both the ecosystem and fisheries.`

  title: "How it Works",
  text: `Blast fishing is an illegal activity and it is challenging to gather reliable information on when and where it occurs, especially because many blasts occur far from the coast.  However, this information is of huge importance for understanding the impact on the environment and to be able to monitor and combat the problem as well as targeting enforcement.

  Sound travels through water 5 times faster than through air and the sound from a blast can be heard 30km away. Therefore, detection of the sound created from each blast using underwater acoustic recorders is a powerful way to monitor blasting over a huge area of the ocean. 
  
  Sea Sensors has placed four underwater acoustic recorders and hydrophones on the sea bed along the coast of Tanzania. Collectively they are monitoring approximately 20% of the entire coast of the country, and will record all sounds in the marine environment over the course of 1 year.  The data is then analysed to identify blasts and where possible triangulate the original location of the blast.
